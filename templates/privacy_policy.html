            <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>The Girl Tallk website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie
is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to
run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
    only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
example, if you personalize Girl Tallk pages, or register with Girl Tallk site or services, a cookie
helps Girl Tallk to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the
process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
and so on. When you return to the same Girl Tallk website, the information you previously
provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Girl Tallk features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
    Girl Tallk services or websites you visit.</p>

Tallk uses the following methods for this purpose:
            <p>-SSL Protocol</p>
            <p>-Site lock</p>
<p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is
protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet
or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to
protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy
limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and
